# Overview

The Explore education statistics API adheres to REST principles. It uses standard HTTP verbs, JSON
encoding in message bodies and provides HTTP status codes for different response types.

The API acts an interface to the Explore education statistics service, currently allowing you to:

- get high level information about publications and their stable data sets
- query data sets for data matching specific criteria
- download the underlying CSV file of a data set

With the provided functionality, you should be able to build things using up-to-date, high quality
data from the Explore education statistics service. Potential ideas for this may include:

- applications and websites
- dashboards and charts
- scheduled reports
