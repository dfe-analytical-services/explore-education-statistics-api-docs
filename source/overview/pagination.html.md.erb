# Pagination

Endpoints that return a list of results may return a paginated response. This is done for
performance reasons to avoid excessively large responses so not all possible results can be
returned in a single request.

The list of results is split into multiple pages (or 'batches') that must be requested separately.

A typical paginated response looks like the following:

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/the-endpoint"
    },
    "next": {
      "href": "/the-endpoint?page=2"
    }
  },
  "paging" : {
    "page" : 1,
    "pageSize" : 3,
    "totalPages" : 2,
    "totalResults" : 5
  },
  "results" : [
    { "id": 1 },
    { "id": 2 },
    { "id": 3 }
  ]
}
```

In the above example, the `paging` property contains paging metadata. This metadata tells you that
there are 5 results (denoted by `totalResults`) split over 2 pages (denoted by `totalPages`).
The `pageSize` property indicates the maximum number of results that can be shown in a single page.

Typically, you need to provide a `page` query parameter in the URL to specify the page of results
you want. In the above example, you would use a URL like `/the-endpoint?page=2` to get the second
page of results.

Some endpoints may allow you to control the page size, meaning that you can adjust the number of
results each page contains. In these cases, a `pageSize` query parameter can be used e.g.
`/the-endpoint?pageSize=5` requests that each page contains 5 results.

The `pageSize` parameter is not always available and may be subject to validation to prevent
excessively large pages.

## Use links for faster navigation

For convenience, the top-level `_links` property will indicate other URLs that you can navigate to
for more results. You will typically see the following:

- `self` links to the current page of results
- `next` links to the next page of results
- `prev` links to the previous page of results

The `prev` and `next` links will only be present if the respective page actually exists. This means
that they will not be available at the pagination boundaries.

The `_links` property can be particuarly useful if you wish to create a UI for navigating through
paginated results.
