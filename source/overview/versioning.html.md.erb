# Versioning

The Explore Education Statistics API uses URL-based versioning. Each endpoint encodes its current
version within its URL e.g. `/api/v1/the-endpoint`, `/api/v2/the-endpoint`, etc.

When backwards-incompatible changes to an endpoint are unavoidable, a new version of the endpoint
will be published. Backwards-incompatible changes may include things like:

- removing properties in the request or response schema
- changing the structure of the request or response schema
- changing validation rules for the request

In the event that a new endpoint version is necessary, the previous version(s) of the endpoint will
be maintained for as long as possible. This should provide ample opportunity to migrate to the new
endpoint version. If necessary, guidance may be provided to support migrating to the new version.

## Data set stability

Data sets available through this API should be amongst the most stable offered by Explore education
statistics, however, changes may be introduced to these data sets over time.

The following things can change:

- new facets can be added
- new data values can be added
- a facet's human-readable label
- existing data values can be changed or removed

The following guarantees can be made in terms of stability:

- a facet's identifier is permanent
- existing facets cannot be deleted

Integrations that query data sets are not expected to break when new releases are published.
