# OpenAPI specification

The Explore education statistics API is fully compliant with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.

## About OpenAPI

The [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) provides a standard language for
documenting REST APIs and their capabilities. Using a document that conforms to this specification,
users should be able to understand how to use an API and navigate through it with minimal effort.

This service's API reference documentation is generated using the OpenAPI specification.

## Getting our OpenAPI specification

You can download the service's OpenAPI specification in either YAML or JSON format.
