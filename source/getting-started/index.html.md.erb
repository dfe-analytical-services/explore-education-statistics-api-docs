# Getting started

The Explore education statistics (EES) API provides a way to directly consume published data from
the EES service using HTTP.

To get started with the EES API, you'll need either:

- an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) if you are exploring the API
- an HTTP client in the programming language of your choice if you are developing on top of the API

## Where to start

If you are not familiar with how HTTP and APIs work, the [Beginner's guide to APIs](beginners-guide-to-apis/index.html)
is recommended reading. This guide will provide foundational knowledge of concepts that will make you
more productive with this documentation.

If you have some familiarity of how HTTP and APIs work, but are new to the EES API, it is recommended
that you read the [Quick start guide](quick-start/index.html). This will run you through the
essentials and the workflow to perform a basic data query.

If you are familiar with the EES API, you will find all relevant reference documentation in the
[Overview](/overview/index.html), [Endpoints](/endpoints/index.html) and [Schemas](/schemas/index.html)
sections.

## Documentation structure

The [Overview section](/overview/index.html) provides high level documentation about the EES API. This details
things such as message formats, error handling, versioning and the OpenAPI specification.

The [Endpoints section](/endpoints/index.html) provides reference documentation about the endpoints available
in the API. This details the requests that can be made and their responses. Code samples are also
provided to illustrate how requests could be made.

The [Schemas section](/schemas/index.html) provides reference documentation about the structure of all the
requests and responses (i.e. their schemas) across the API. Each schema provides in-depth detail
about their properties, including their type and validation rules.
