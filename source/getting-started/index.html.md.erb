# Getting started

The Explore education statistics (EES) API provides a way to directly consume published data from
the EES service using HTTP.

To get started with the EES API, you'll need either:

- an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) if you are exploring the API
- an HTTP client in the programming language of your choice if you are developing on top of the API

## Where to start

There are three suggested starting points that are recommended depending on your knowledge of HTTP,
APIs and the EES API.

### Beginner level

If you are not familiar with how HTTP and APIs work, it is recommended that you start with the
[Beginner's guide to APIs](beginners-guide-to-apis/index.html). This guide will provide knowledge of
foundational concepts that will make you more productive with the rest of the API documentation.

Once you are more confident with these topics, the [Quick start guide](quick-start/index.html) is
a good next step.

### Intermediate level

If you are familiar with how HTTP and APIs work, but are new to the EES API, it is recommended
that you start with the [Quick start guide](quick-start/index.html). This will guide you through
essential parts of the API and the workflow to perform a basic data set query.

Following this, the [Overview](/overview/index.html) section is a good next step for a more in-depth
understanding of the high level parts of the EES API.

To assist in specific tasks once you've started using the EES API, there are additional guides under
the 'Getting started' dropdown of the left menu that you may find useful.

### Expert level

If you are already familiar with the EES API, you will find all relevant reference documentation in
the [Overview](/overview/index.html), [Endpoints](/endpoints/index.html) and [Schemas](/schemas/index.html)
sections.

## Documentation structure

The [Overview section](/overview/index.html) provides high level documentation about the EES API. This details
things such as message formats, error handling, versioning and the OpenAPI specification.

The [Endpoints section](/endpoints/index.html) provides reference documentation about the endpoints available
in the API. This details the requests that can be made and their responses. Code samples are also
provided to illustrate how requests could be made.

The [Schemas section](/schemas/index.html) provides reference documentation about the structure of all the
requests and responses (i.e. their schemas) across the API. Each schema provides in-depth detail
about their properties, including their type and validation rules.
