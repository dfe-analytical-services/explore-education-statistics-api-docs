# Getting started

The Explore education statistics (EES) API provides a way to directly consume published data from
the EES service using HTTP.

To get started with the EES API, you will need either:

- an API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) if you are exploring the API
- a HTTP client in the programming language of your choice if you are developing on top of the API

## Where to start

If you are new to the EES API, it is recommended that you read the [Quick start guide](quick-start/index.html).
This will run you through the essentials and the workflow to perform a basic data query.

If you are familiar with the EES API, you should be able to find all relevant reference documentation
in the [Overview](/overview/index.html), [Endpoints](/endpoints/index.html) and [Schemas](/schemas/index.html) sections.

## Documentation structure

The [Overview section](/overview/index.html) provides high level documenation about the EES API. This details
things such as message formats, error handling, versioning and the OpenAPI specification.

The [Endpoints section](/endpoints/index.html) provides reference documentation about the endpoints available
in the API. This details the requests that can be made and their responses. Code samples are also
provided to illustrate how requests could be made.

The [Schemas section](/schemas/index.html) provides reference documentation about the structure of all the
requests and responses (i.e. their schemas) across the API. Each schema provides in-depth detail
about their properties, including their type and validation rules.
