# How to get CSV data

In this guide, you'll learn how to get CSV data from the Explore education statistics (EES) API.
This may be particularly useful if you wish to access data sets in their entirety, or find it more
comfortable to work with CSVs.

## What you'll need

You should already be familiar with the EES API. If not, you should read the [Quick start](/getting-started/quick-start/index.html)
guide first as this guide will presume some prior knowledge.

To run request examples in this guide, it is a good idea to come prepared with a HTTP or API client
tool. Good recommendations for beginners are [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

Some prior knowledge of working with your chosen HTTP client will be necessary to work with the
examples.

## Get an entire data set as a CSV file

Every data set is created from an underlying CSV file that **all** the data. You may find it useful
(or necessary) to work with the underlying CSV instead of interacting with the data set via the API.

The underlying CSV file can be downloaded via the [Get a data set's underlying CSV file](/endpoints/GetDataSetFile/index.html)
endpoint. To use this endpoint, you need to make the follow `GET` request:

```
GET <%= api_url "/api/v1/data-sets/{dataSetId}/file" %>
```

In the request URL, you would substitute the `{dataSetId}` parameter with your chosen data set's ID.

Upon making this request, a download should start. The download will contain a ZIP archive containing
the underlying CSV file.

Data set CSV files are compressed using ZIP as they can be quite large and reach into hundreds of
megabytes in size.

## Get data set query results in CSV format

Queries can be ran against data sets to find data matching specific criteria using the
[Query a data set](/endpoints/QueryDataSet/index.html) endpoint. By default, this endpoint returns the data in
JSON format, however, you can also request to return it in CSV format.

You can do this by changing the `POST` request's `Accept` header to `text/csv`. This would look
something like the following:

```
POST <%= api_url "/api/v1/data-sets/{dataSetId}/query" %>
Accept: text/csv

{
  # your query
}
```

As usual, substitute the `{dataSetId}` parameter with your chosen data set's ID.

The CSV data will be formatted as it would appear in the full data set CSV file, but it is filtered
down to only contain the data that matches your query.
