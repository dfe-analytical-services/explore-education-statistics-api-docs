# API Schemas

This section lists all the schemas available on the Explore education statistics (EES) API.

A schema details the data structure of a request or response used in the API. Schemas are typically
composed of a set of properties and information about each of these is provided, including:

- the property name
- the property type e.g. string, number, boolean, array, object, etc
- is it required?
- a description of the property
- the validation rules that apply

Examples of each schema are provided to give a flavour of how the schema will look in practice.
Note that these may use example data that does not reflect a true request/response from the API.
